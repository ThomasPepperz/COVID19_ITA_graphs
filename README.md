# COVID19-ITA-regions
This (little) project aims to plot regional data using R. Please note I'm an R *beginner*: the code works, but it may contain errors and/or repetitions. Any contribution is of course well accepted and appreciated.

**Important:** I do not have any responsability nor control on the data source.
