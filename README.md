# COVID19-ITA-regions
This (little) project aims to plot regional data using R.
Data is retrieved from Italian Civil [Protection GitHub](https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19/tree/master/dati-regioni).

Any contribution is well accepted and appreciated. I do not want to retain any copyright on this work. **Important:** I do not have any responsability nor control on the data source.
