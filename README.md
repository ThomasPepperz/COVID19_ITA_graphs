# COVID19-ITA-regions
Hi! I'm Andrea, a medical doctor and a research fellow at [CRIMEDIM - Research Center in Emergency and Disaster Medicine](https://crimedim.uniupo.it/) - [Universit√† del Piemonte Orientale](https://www.uniupo.it/), Italy.

This (little) project aims to plot regional data using R. Please note I'm an R *beginner*: the code works, but it may contain errors and/or repetitions. Any contribution is of course well accepted and appreciated.

**Important:** I do not have any responsability nor control on the data source.
